In this assessment, you will be asked to grade five of your peer's mini-projects. In return, five of your peers will grade your project. 
Since you've worked hard on your mini-project and would like your peers to do a good job of assessing your project, 
please take your time and do a good job of assessing your peer's mini-projects in return. 
Before beginning your assessment, please review the video lecture on "Guess the Number" to see a demonstration of a correct, 
full-credit implementation of the mini-project.

For each item below, run your peer's program (in Chrome, Firefox or Safari) and observe its behavior. 
If the program demonstrates the correct associated functionality, give it full credit for that item. 
If the program demonstrates partial, inconsistent, or incorrect functionality, assign the program partial credit based on your testing and our comments. 
When assigning partial or no credit, please add a short written comment that describes the issues you observed. 
While this takes extra effort, please remember how frustrating it would be to receive partial or no credit on part of your mini-project with no accompanying explanation.
